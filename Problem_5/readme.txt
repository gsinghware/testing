The FAO data under live stock was used to extract time series 
for the population of the he number of pigs, ducks, goats, sheep, 
cattle, chickents and turkeys in the continents Africa, North America, 
South America, Asia, Europe and Austrailia + New Zeland for year 2007. 

A separate bar graph was created for each of the continents comparing the number of pigs, 
ducks, goats, sheep, cattle, chickents and turkeys. That was 6 bar graphs with 
7 bars each. A stacked bar graph was used to combine these in a single graph.

The graphs were generated one after the other.
